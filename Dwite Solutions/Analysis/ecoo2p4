The "MINE - YOU LOSE" case is obviously very easy. So is the "NO MINE - ... SURROUNDING IT" case. The only nontrivial case is the one in 
which a large number of squares are revealed because the clicked square and all its neighbours are unmined. This is best tackled using a 
flood fill; once we reach a square that has at least one mine surrounding it, we stop exploring from that square. Don't forget to restore 
the grid back to its original configuration after each test case.
