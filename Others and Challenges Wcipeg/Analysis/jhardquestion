Let t1 be the time it takes for the stone to hit the bottom of the well. 
The remaining time taken by the sound to climb back up is t-t1. Let the depth of the well be x. Then,

x=gt12/2
x=c(t-t1)

Equating the right sides yields
gt12/2=c(t-t1)
This is expanded to give
gt12/2+ct1-ct=0
and then solved using the quadratic formula. The positive sign must be taken, since the negative sign would give a negative answer, 
which is inadmissible. Using the value of t1 thus obtained allows us to calculate x, the depth of the well. Also, we have v, the 
final velocity, equal to gt1.
