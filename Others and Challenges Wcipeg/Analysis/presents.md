This is a greedy problem. In order to make the total dissatisfaction minimal, we give each child the best present they deserve. 
We note that a dynamic solution will take up too much memory, and hence it must be a greedy solution.

We read in the data, and sort the presents and children in non ascending order of value. Then we loop through each child, and find the 
present with the most points that does not exceed this child's maximal value. Adding up these differences, we arrive at our answer.
