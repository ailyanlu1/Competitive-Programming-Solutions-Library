This problem is basically an exercise in implementation: it is not so hard to code, but if you are a novice, it takes some thought to avoid writing code that is long and complicated. It's useful to use an array of 4 strings in order to keep track of the cards you have in each suit; that way you can avoid writing the same code over and over again for each suit. 
For example, see submission 11194 by Bryan.
