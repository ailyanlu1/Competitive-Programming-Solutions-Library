This is a straightforward problem using if-statements and strings, and mainly a test of the contestant's 
ability to read statements. We read both the area code and the local number as strings. If the area code is exactly "416" and the 
local number has 7 digits, then it must be valuable. Otherwise, if the area code is "647" or "437", and the local number has 7 digits, 
then it must be valueless. Otherwise, it must be invalid.

An issue is that one might be tempted to read the two sequences as integers, seeing that the input format guaranteed that both sequences 
do not exceed 9 digits. The issue here is that when we store numbers as integers, information about any leading zero digits are lost, and 
we then cannot confirm whether the input was originally the right number of digits. This should have been made clear by sample input 1. 
The fact that the input may have involved area codes that weren't 3 digits long is both implied by the 9 digit limitation, and explicitly 
stated by the "4161 596111" example in the description.

Official Solution (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

string ac, ln;

int main() {
  cin >> ac >> ln;
  if (ac == "416" && ln.size() == 7) {
    cout << "valuable" << endl;
  } else if ((ac == "647" || ac == "437") && ln.size() == 7) {
    cout << "valueless" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "invalid" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
