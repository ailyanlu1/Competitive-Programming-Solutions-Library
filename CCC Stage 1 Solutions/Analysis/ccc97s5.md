This problem is simply annoying, and there's really no nice way to code it, so you'll just have to hack up something that works. 
There isn't really any model solution you can look at either, since there are too many details to memorize them all.

Just implement the method they tell you to. There isn't really a better way. Just as in ordinary long division, 
fill in the quotient one digit at a time proceeding from left to right. The numbers are not that long, so you can get away with an 
inefficient implementation using strings or arrays of individual digits.
