This is an easy problem; it can be solved by simply trying all integers 0 < n < m and checking whether xn is congruent to 1 (modulo m). 
However, it is also possible to compute mod inverses in time logarithmic in m, using the 
Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This technique is worth knowing, for harder problems that may require more efficient 
computation of mod inverses
