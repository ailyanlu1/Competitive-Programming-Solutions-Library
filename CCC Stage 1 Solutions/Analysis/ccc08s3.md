One way of rephrasing this problem is: What is the shortest path from the top left corner to the bottom right? 
Because this is an unweighted graph, the algorithm to use is breadth-first search (BFS). 
BFS is a better algorithm to use than DFS in this type of problem because BFS "fans out" across the grid, goes to each intersection as 
quickly as possible and never goes to the same spot more than once. As a result of this, BFS yields faster solutions 
(on bigger graphs) than DFS.
