Inlucdes Normal CCC Stage 1 and mockCCC from Wcipeg.  
Files are labeled as name, year, and question number with level --> ccc08s2 --> CCC Stage 1 2008 Senior question 2  
For Clairfications, go to wcipeg for codes to match the file that you want
And as a final note, I believe I have finished all the CCC stage 1 questions up until 2017, so almost all the solutions are on here
