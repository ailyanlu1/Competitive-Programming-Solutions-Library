This is mostly a straightforward problem. Our primary concern is the question of how large the numbers can get and how long it might take 
before a repetition occurs. The first question is relatively easy to answer: the input has at most 7 digits, so the factorial sum is at 
most 7Ã—9! = 2540160, which also has 7 digits; so no number in the sequence will ever have more than 7 digits. So there are at most 107 
different numbers we can encounter altogether, and as soon as we encounter a number for the second time, we're done; so we'll be done in 
at most 107 steps. (In practice, the number of steps will be much less than this.)
