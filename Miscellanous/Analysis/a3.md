The version of this problem presented on the PEG Judge is very easy to solve. You just have to keep incrementing k until you get some 

number whose cube ends in 888. A 64-bit integer type should be used to avoid overflow.

The SPOJ problem from which this was taken, however, is somewhat more interesting. Here, k can be up to 2Ã—1012, and it is required to 

find the kth positive integer whose cube ends in 888. Clearly, this cannot be solved using the naive approach that works for the 

easier version of the problem. You are recommended to try that problem. 

(Hint: do you notice something about the outputs of your program for the easy PEG Judge version?)
