This problem is solved by straightforward simulation, although there is a tendency for many people to write overly complicated solutions. 
A simple solution is obtained by doing the simulation one kilometre at a time; a full hour elapses only after each s iterations, 
and we stop if we ever find ourselves back at the origin.
