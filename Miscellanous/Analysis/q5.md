There are many ways to solve this problem, none of which are necessarily "better" or "worse" than any others. For example, 
filling out the grid using the input string, alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left, and then reading down the 
columns and across the rows is the straightforward approach, and is a perfectly reasonable way to solve the problem. 
The more ambitious among you might attempt to perform the decoding "in-place".
