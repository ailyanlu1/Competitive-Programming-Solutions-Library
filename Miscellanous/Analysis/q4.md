This is a rather simple question, involving 2-d arrays.

First, you’re always going to have 4 rows and 4 columns of X's or O's, so, just set your 2-d array, grid, to [1..4,1..4] of char (X or O).

After you read grid in, check to see if each row or column are all X's. If there is at least one row or column of all X's, 
then check is true. If there are any diagonals then check is true as well. There can only be 2 diagonals, from the top-right of the grid 
to the bottom left, or from the top-left to the bottom-right. So, to implement this into your code,

```
For i:=1 to 4 do
  If grid[i,1]='X' and grid[i,2]='X', etc. then
    check:=true;
For i:=1 to 4 do
  If grid[1,i]='X' and grid[2,i]='X' then
    check:=true;
If grid[1,1]='X' and grid[2,2]='X' and grid[3,3]='X' and grid[4,4]='X' {to check diagonals} then
  check:=true;
If grid[1,4]='X' and grid[2,3]='X' and grid[3,2]='X' and grid[4,1]='X' {another diagonal} then
  check:=true;
```

Now this part is easy. If check is true then output ‘Yes’. If check is false then output ‘No’.
