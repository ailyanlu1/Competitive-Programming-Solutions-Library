This famous problem is known as the Tower of Hanoi. A simple and completely solved problem, 
it is often used to teach mathematical reasoning, problem solving, and recursion, and various different interpretations of the 
solution exist. You've obviously managed to find at least one of these, but it should be worthwhile to check out Wikipedia for 
additional information.
