The Canadian coin system lends itself to the greedy change algorithm. That is, we first determine the 
greatest number of quarters that fits into the amount given, and we use exactly that many quarters; then we see how many dimes fit into 
the remaining amount, and so on. Printing the answer is the only tricky part: we have to keep in mind three rules:

If there are none of a given coin used, don't mention the coin.
If there is only one of a given coin used, use the singular.
The last coin mentioned should be followed by a period, not a comma.
There are many ways to satisfy these rules; see any of the accepted solutions for details.
