The algorithm here is to go row by row from the top left corner and try to fit the smallest number (unique in that row and column) for 
every square.

If we happen get to a column in a row and find we cannot place a number, we must backtrack to previous columns and try again by placing 
the next smallest number in that spot.

For example:

```
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 _
```

After placing the smallest possible number for each spot in row two, we find that we cannot place the last number (5) in the remaining
spot, thus we must backtrack to the last column and change it.

```
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 5 3
...
```
