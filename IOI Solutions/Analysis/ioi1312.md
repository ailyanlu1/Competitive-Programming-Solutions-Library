This is an interesting heuristics problem that requires a good amount of creative insight. It can be solved in many ways, 

depending on specific observations you choose to make about the four styles.

On the real IOI, nine images of each style were randomly chosen from the test data for each contestant to visually analyze. 

The remaining images were used for grading. A modification has been made for the PEG judge. 

The problem statement here provides 4 images from each style, but the actual input data is given for each image. 

Note that currently, these 16 images ARE included in the test data used for grading.

While it is helpful, advanced background knowledge of colour channeling and digital image processing is not explicitly 

required for coming up with a perfect solution. Following are important observations related to each style:

```
Style 1 contains many regions of non-grainy and relatively uniform colors, separated by black borders. White is also very predominant. 
To detect regions, we can perform floodfills. For each pixel, we only flood to the neighbouring pixels when the Euclidean distance 
between their two colors (treat RGB as 3D coordinates) is within some tolerance level. We stop flooding when black pixels part of the 
region borders are reached. For each region we flood, we can even calculate the standard deviation of colors. 
A higher deviation indicates graininess. Thus, a low standard deviation, a large percentage of white pixels, and a low number of 
uniform regions (in comparison to the grainier styles below which will yield lots of regions) are all indicators of this style.
```
   
```
Style 2 contains an abundance of the color green. We should loop through the 2D grid of pixels and calculate the averages of the R 
channel, the G channel, and the B channel respectively. We can then check to see if the average of the green channel is significantly 
larger than the average of the other two channels. Also, this is a grainy style, in contrast to styles 1 and 4.
```
   
```
Style 3, like style 2, is also very grainy. There is no predominance of green colors.
```
   
```
Style 4 is similar to style 1. However, there are no thin black borders separating the uniform regions. 
There is no predominance of white regions, and there are generally fewer regions overall.
```
   

Thus, the following logic is appropriate for categorizing the images:

```
If there are a lot of regions with uniform colors:
If there are black borders separating regions/lots of white regions: style 1.
Otherwise: style 4.
Otherwise if the picture is grainy:
If there are a lot of green pixels (average of green channel is high): style 2.
Otherwise: style 3.
The actual implementation will require quite a bit of experimentation and tweaking to determine appropriate values for the 
floodfill tolerances, channel comparisons, grainy factor, etc.
```
